description: Sometimes, a seemingly trivial turn of events can spiral into a huge
  mess. That's exactly what happens in Stanley J. Weyman's story "The Snowball," in
  which a casually tossed clod of ice and snow sets off an international incident.
  Packed with political intrigue from start to finish, fans of fast-paced historical
  fiction will thoroughly enjoy it.
